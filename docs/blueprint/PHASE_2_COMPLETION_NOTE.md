# Phase 2 Completion Note

Phase 2 is complete. Systems interact without a dominant path, evidence
reliability and inference pressure introduce doubt, and timing/lead decay
forces real trade-offs. Different playstyles on the same seed produce distinct
outcomes and state changes without collapsing uncertainty.

Stop here. Phase 3 should begin from a clean baseline.
