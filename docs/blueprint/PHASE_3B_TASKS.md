# Phase 3B - Interview System (Stateful Interviews)
Roadmap section: docs/blueprint/ROADMAP.md#phase-3b---interview-system-stateful-interviews

Phase question:
Can dialogue create tradeoffs and risk without becoming a tree?

Phase 3B is not:
- a dialogue tree with a correct path
- a QTE timing minigame
- a real-world interrogation simulator

## Scope (allowed)
- Interview protocol states (baseline, pressure, shutdown, confession).
- Rapport and resistance as costs and risks.
- Lies are explicit and motive-driven, not random noise.
- Statements become evidence with confidence bands.
- Theme framing choices (minimization) as a pressure tool.
- Baseline profile metrics tracked (sentence length, tense, pronoun ratio).
- Linguistic tell cues are template-based only (no NLP yet).
- Baseline metrics are used only for uncertainty hooks.

## Core changes
1) Interview protocol
- Baseline: gather neutral facts and establish tone.
- Pressure: challenge or confront; risk of shutdown.
- Shutdown: witness refuses or leaves; lead goes cold.
- Confession: only if pressure and evidence align.
- Theme development: offer a framing that reduces resistance.

2) Motive to lie
- NPCs can lie to protect reputation, alibis, or third parties.
- Lies appear as explicit false edges in presentation.

3) Evidence from dialogue
- Each interview yields 0 to 2 evidence items.
- Confidence bands reflect rapport and pressure outcomes.
- Contradictions are possible and legible.
- Temporal gaps or equivocation appear as explicit uncertainty hooks.

## Data model (minimal)
- InterviewState: phase, rapport, resistance, fatigue, baseline_profile, last_claims.
- ResponseTemplate: phase, approach, text, claim_tags, uncertainty_hooks, confidence_band.
- EvidenceEmission: evidence_type, summary, claim_tags, confidence_band, uncertainty_hooks.

## Constraints (non-negotiable)
- No NLP or spaCy-driven analysis in this phase.
- No QTE or reflex-based denial handling.
- No profiling accuracy boosts.
- No "correct answer" dialog path.
- Interview system is framed as an in-world protocol, not real-world training.

## Deliverables
- Interview state machine with costs and failure paths.
- Evidence items generated by interviews with uncertainty hooks.
- Cooperation decay for repeated or aggressive interviews.
- At least one contradiction path per case seed.

## Exit checklist
- [ ] Interviews can go cold and remove leads.
- [ ] At least two interview styles produce different evidence confidence.
- [ ] Lies are explicit and explainable after the fact.
- [ ] Contradictions can appear and remain unresolved.
- [ ] No new mechanics outside the interview action.

Stop condition:
If interviews feel risky and tradeoffs are visible, stop.
