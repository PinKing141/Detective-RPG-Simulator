## Typology constraints (generation gates)
Visionary:
- Allowed: Ritual objects, Linguistic, Scene geometry
- Strong fits: 17-32, 49-60, 33-36
- Rare: 65-76

Mission-oriented:
- Allowed: Linguistic, Minimalist, Forensic signatures
- Strong fits: 49-60, 1-16, 65-76
- Rare: 26-32

Hedonistic (thrill/lust):
- Allowed: Scene geometry, Ritual objects, Forensic patterns
- Strong fits: 37-48, 23-32, 79, 77
- Rare: minimalist-only as sole motif

Power/Control:
- Allowed: Forensic signatures, Scene geometry, Minimalist
- Strong fits: 65-76, 33-48, 4-8
- Rare: theatrical ritual motifs (26-32)

## Hard rules (to keep it clean)
- Signature is a bundle: 1 primary motif + 1 supporting trace.
- Competence gates:
  - low competence avoids 65-76
  - high competence favors 65-76 plus one minimalist token
- Exposure gates:
  - high exposure favors subtle motifs (1-16, 65-76)
  - low exposure allows theatrical motifs (17-32, 33-48)
- No-body crimes use scene behavior motifs (33-48, 49-64).

## Copycat vs true signature (assessment)
Copycats copy what is visible and miss what is structural.

Four-check test:
1) Bundle integrity (primary + supporting trace present)
2) Constraint fit (typology rules honored)
3) Craft consistency (quality matches competence)
4) Comfort zone coherence (victimology + district align)

Output labels (no percentages):
- Pattern Confirmed (3-4 checks)
- Pattern Suspected (2 checks)
- Imitation Likely (primary only; fails bundle/constraint)
- Pattern Rejected (no meaningful match)

Copycat generation rules:
- Copycat always copies the visible motif.
- Copycat almost never copies forensic traces correctly.
- Copycat context follows their own motive, so victimology often diverges.

## Pattern unit case-file template (BAU tone)
Case File Addendum: Pattern Unit
File: PATTERN / [Motif Name]
Status: [Confirmed / Suspected / Imitation Likely / Rejected]

What matches
Short, concrete description of the visible motif.

What does not
One plain-language mismatch (no system jargon).

Working interpretation
A grounded inference that changes priorities, not certainty.

Next actions
1 to 2 operational steps.
