# Phase 1 Completion Note

Phase 1 is complete. The investigation loop supports claim-based hypotheses,
lead clocks, consequences that carry forward, and divergent outcomes across
different evidence paths. Evidence implies rather than states, and outcomes are
legible without exposing hidden truth.

Stop here. Phase 2 should begin from a clean baseline.
